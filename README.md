This project was created by Rachel Frenkel and Sam Broner for Tufts University.

It was inspired by http://www.slow-journalism.com/oscars-infographic , which analyzes past Oscar winners and roles and determines the most common traits so that you will know how to win an Oscar.

We analyzed the top 100 songs of all time as compiled by the Rolling Stones.
The attributtes of these songs are in the middle. The automatic attribute values shown are the most common among all 100 songs. If you hover over an attribute, it will highlight all of the songs which fulfill it. If you would like to change an attribute and see how many songs fulfill that, you may select your choice from the menu. If you would like to select more than one attribute, you can click on all of the attribute title that you wish to combine (make sure it turns blue). Then click the multiselect button, and only songs fulfilling all of those attributes will highlight.
You may click on the song titles on the side for more information about the song, and if you hit the play button it will play a preview of the song.
